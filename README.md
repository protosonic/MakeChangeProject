# Make Change Project

## Description
A simple Java program that calculates change for a transaction. The program allows the user to input the cost of an iten and the amount tendered, determines if the payment is sufficient, then breaks down the amount due into appropriate denominations.

## Technologies used
- Java
- Eclipse
- Git/Github
- Sublime Text Editor
- Search Engines

## Concepts Applied
- While loop
- Switch statements
- Conditional Statement
- If statesment
- Indeed used %
- Iterative looping
- Calling methods and calling methods within methods


## Lessons Learned
- Being determined to use loop and switches proved to be extremeley difficult to parse out in my head
- Had to sketch out flows on scratch paper
- Using a different method to loop and determine the change would probably be better
- Unicode can be interesting to use in simple programs
- I'm a fan of ASCII titles
